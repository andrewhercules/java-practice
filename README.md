After researching various Junior Developer employment opportunities, I decided it would be best to become familiar with Java due to its popularity as a programming language. As a guide, I am using Herbert Schildt's [Java: A Beginner's Guide (6th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Guide-Edition-ebook/dp/B005RWFQB4).
